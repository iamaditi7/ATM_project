    "## MY ATM Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project is a basic level functioning model of an ATM i.e. Automated Teller Machine. It is designed with the with the goal to develop a runtime software that acts as an ATM machine for a user with the use of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader scope of this project is to practice and showcase our understanding of Object Oriented Programming using Python. More specifically, the use of encapsulation and base class inheritence. And, the use of OOP provides layered security for the users information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim at creating an ATM software which has the following features to both a 'Savings' and a 'Checking' account: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Account Details\n",
    "2. Check Saving Balance\n",
    "3. Deposit Funds\n",
    "4. Withdraw Funds\n",

    "6. Back\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE)\n",
    "2. Understanding of OOP Concepts\n"
